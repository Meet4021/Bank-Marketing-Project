# Predictive-Analytics-for-Bank-Marketing


## Project Purpose

This project will build a machine learning model to allow a bank to predict the outcome of a marketing campaign for each of its clients. This will allow the bank to focus its efforts on the clients that are most likely to respond positively to the campaign.

Four types of classifier algorithms were tested:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Random Decision Forest
3.	K-Nearest Neighbours
4.	Support Vector Classification


## Repository Contents

This repository contains a file for each stage of a project to build a predictive model:
1.	Project Proposal
2.	Data Cleaning, Exploration and Preparation
3.	Feature Selection
4.	Predictive Modeling
5.	Project Presentation
6.	Final Project Report


## Executing the Code

Download the dataset and the Jupyter notebook from this repository.

Place the dataset in the top directory of the “C” drive, or modify the Jupyter notebook so that it reads the dataset from the directory of your choice.
