# Predictive Analytics for a Bank Marketing Campaign


## Purpose

This project will build a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a marketing campaign for each client of a bank. This will allow the bank to focus its marketing efforts on the clients that are most likely to respond positively to the campaign.

Four types of classification algorithms will be tested:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Random Decision Forest
3.	K-Nearest Neighbours
4.	Support Vector Classification


## Repository Contents

This repository contains a file for each stage of the project:
